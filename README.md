# MA305FinalProject
---
This is a repository to host our group's code for our final project for MA305 Fall 2022 at ERAU DB. This code is split into modules that can be used in other files, which allows for easy and convenient functionality between files. Using this, our code is structured in two primary files, `main.py` and `plots.py`.

`main.py` goes through every method and displays their formatted outputs in the terminal. There may be another accompanying file in the future that gives users the ability to choose the specific method they would like to use.

`plots.py` generates plots of the different methods as iterations increase. Plots are also generated to provide comparisons and allow for further analysis.

The wiki tab may be set up to allow easy to navigate documentation of our modules and the methods within them.

LaTeX work will be in its respective folder.
