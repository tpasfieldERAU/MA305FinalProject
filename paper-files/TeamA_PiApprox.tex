\section{Introduction}\label{S:1}
%The text of this section.
% Write a brief description (background/significance) of what the project is about. \\

Pi is an extremely useful number, being fundamental to mathematics for so much more than just geometry, and having extensive applications in physics. It is simply the ratio of the circumference of a circle and the diameter of the circle, yet applies to so much more. Being such a useful number, it is important that we have an accurate value for it, and can calculate it as needed. This paper explores different methods of these calculations, using three categories of methods. These categories are numerical integration, sum of alternating series, and Monte Carlo integration.


\section{Problem Statement}\label{S:2}
%The text of this section. 
% Explain meaning of all symbols used. Make clear what is given and what we are looking for. 
The goal is to approximate $\pi$ with Python using different methods, and to provide an analysis of the methods relative to each other. The code must accept a number of iterations, the ''N-value'', and run each method using that value. 

\section{Method/Analysis}\label{S:3}
%Text introducing this section
% Begin with naming or characterizing the method/approach to be used, perhaps explain the basic idea behind it, to what type of problems it applies, under what conditions, what it achieves, what are its main features, advantages, disadvantages. Justify why it is applicable to this problem, stating clearly any assumptions you need to make about the problem for the method to apply. Name some other methods/approaches one could use, and if/why your method may be preferable.


\subsection{Part I}\label{S:3.1}
Put an explanation of the methodology behind the numerical integration method here, such as where pi comes from in the integral and why.

\subsection{Part II}\label{S:3.2}
Put an explanation for how and why pi emerges from the alternating series here. The whole `arctan` component and more too.

\subsection{Part III}\label{S:3.3}
A Monte Carlo estimator is a method of approximating an explicit value using randomness. In the case of approximating pi, a uniform sample of random points will approach the ratio between the
Pi occurs in many, many parts of geometry. The most prevalent location being the equation to find the area of a circle, $A=\pi r^2$.


\section{Solutions/Results}\label{S:4}
%Text introducing this section
This section contains the presentation of your solution and results.
Describe your implementation of the method(s) for this specific problem, any special features, numerical methods implementation  strategy, choices of any parameters, stopping criteria, etc.
Present the results in words and plots (annotate by hand if necessary), explain what they mean. Include your code in an Appendix.

\section{Discussion/Conclusions}\label{S:5}
%Text introducing this subsection
Interpret your solution physically, what we learn from it, comment on strengths and weaknesses of the solution method, any nice features you want to brag about, possible ways to improve it (e.g. how to make it more accurate, more efficient), as appropriate.
